                 <p>In 2010, N5SRP established the Olney Community Collaborative (OCC) as a way to join residents and merchants through activities. Korean, Latin and African cultural events, neighborhood cleanup days, open mic nights, summer youth employment programs and community mural paintings are just a few ways the OCC has used Olneyâ€™s assets and diversity to foster community cohesion along North 5th Street.</p>

                 <p>Clean and beautiful streets make a neighborhood pleasant for its residents and inviting to outside shoppers. N5SRP hires two sidewalk cleaning specialists to remove litter and maintain overall cleanliness along North 5th Street on a Monday through Friday schedule. Colorful banners, benches at bus stops and new murals have also been installed by N5SPRP to make North 5th Street an attractive centerpiece to the Olney neighborhood.</p>
